It is not the goal of this book to introduce beginners completely to the programming language "R" and the environment in general. There are many really good sources where you can familiarize yourself with "R" if necessary.

- [Engineering Data Analysis in R - Chapter 2 "The R Programming Environment"](https://smogdr.github.io/edar_coursebook/rprog1.html){target="_blank"}

Throughout the book, reference is made to these two continuative sources and you only need to read the one that appeals to you more. In the referenced chapters, these cover similar content.
