# (PART) R Basics {-}

# Introduction to R Basics
It is not the goal of this book to introduce beginners to the programming language "R" and the environment in general. There are many really good sources where you can familiarize yourself with "R" if needed.

Two sources are recommended to facilitate the introduction to "R" and to learn the relevant basics. Choose one that suits you and go through the recommended chapter:

- <a href="https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/r-basics.html" target="_blank">Introduction to Data Science - Chapter 2 "R Basics"</a>
- <a href="https://smogdr.github.io/edar_coursebook/rprog1.html" target="_blank">Engineering Data Analysis in R - Chapter 2 "The R Programming Environment"</a>

The part "R-Basics" in this book is additive to the basics referenced above and focuses on practical examples of how data can be loaded, transformed and analyzed.
