# Introduction
## Preface
This book gives you an overview of the statistical software R and its ability to analyze and visualize time series in the context of building energy and comfort.

It is aimed at R beginners as well as exerienced R users and is strongly inspired by the <a href="https://r-graphics.org/" target="_blank">R Graphics Cookbook</a> and <a href="https://smogdr.github.io/edar_coursebook/" target="_blank">Engineering Data Analysis in R</a>. The aim of this book is to provide additional specific recipes for energy and comfort related tasks and to make your entry into R smooth and easy. 

## Content
The book is independently structured and a beginner gets information on how to install the program environment and gets a quick practical introduction.

The examples in this book will show you how to complete certain specific tasks. Examples are shown so that you can understand the basic principle and reproduce the analysis or visualization with your own data. Simply copy the code into your R-script, replace the sample data files with your own and execute the code.

This book was developed using Yihui Xie's <a href="https://bookdown.org" target="_blank">bookdown</a> framework. The book is built  using code that combines R code, data, and text to create a book for which R code and examples can be re-executed every time the book is re-built.
The online book is hosted using GitHub's free <a href="https://pages.github.com" target="_blank">GitHub Pages</a>. All material for this book is available and can be explored at the book's <a href="https://github.com/hslu-ige-laes/edar" target="_blank">GitHub repository</a>.


## Why R and RStudio?
In a study commissioned by the Swiss Federal Office of Energy, people from the field were asked how and where they perform energy analyses and create visualizations. The result was that many people today either need Excel or use a building monitoring program. Excel users are pushing the program to its limits with the ever-increasing data sets. Also the interactive ability of the graphics is limited. The change to an environment like R seems to be difficult for many. In the market there are numerous books which make the change to R for other disciplines easier. However, experts from the energy and building services engineering industry lack a corresponding work. The present book is intended to close this gap.

The programming language R and its graphical user interface RStudio offer many more possibilities for data analysis and data visualization.
