# Seasonal Plots
Seasonal plots are a graphical tool to visualize and detect seasonality in a time series. Based on a selected periodicity it emphasizes the seasonal patterns and also shows the changes in seasonality over time. Especially, it allows to detect changes between different seasons.

```{r out.width='70%', fig.cap='Seasonal Plot Overlapping per Month over 10 Years', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/plotSeasonalXY.png")
```

However, such plots are only useful if the period of the seasonality is already known. In many cases, this will in fact be known. For example, monthly data typically has a period of 12. If the period is not known, an autocorrelation plot or spectral plot can be used to determine it.

This chapter shows some useful types of seasonal plots.
