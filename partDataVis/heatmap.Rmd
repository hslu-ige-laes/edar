# Heat Maps
Temporal patterns can show at what time certain devices are exposed to how much load. Heatmaps show quantitative values based on two axes. These can be day and hours, month and day, etc. The cell at the intersection contains the corresponding value. Depending on the context, this can be an average value, a maximum/minimum value, etc. This representation allows the viewer to see short-term patterns and long-term trends in the data with a higher temporal granularity.
