# R Basics
## Packages in R {#packages}
Many functions of R are not pre-installed and must be loaded manually. R packages are similar to libraries in C, Python etc. An R package bundles useful functions, help files and data sets. You can use these functions within your own R code once you load the package.

The following chapters describe how to install, load, update and use packages.

### Installing a Package
The easiest way to install an R Package is to use the RStudio tab "Packages":

```{r knitr-logo, echo=FALSE, out.width='50%', fig.show='hold', fig.cap='Install packages via RStudio GUI'}
knitr::include_graphics(rep('images/a2-installPackagesRStudio.png'))
```

a) Click on the “Packages” tab

b) Click on “Install” next to Update

c) Type the name of the package under “Packages, in this case type ggplot2

d) Click “Install”

This will search for the package "ggplot" specified on a server (the so-called CRAN website). If the package exists, it will be downloaded to a library folder on your computer. Here R can access the package in future R sessions without having to reinstall it.

An other way is to use the install.packages function.
Open R (if already opened please close all projects) and type the following at the command line:
```r
install.packages("ggplot2")
```

If you want to install a package directly from github, the package "devtools" must be installed first:

```r
install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
install_github("hslu-ige-laes/redutils")
```

### Loading a Package
If you have installed a package, its functions are not yet available in your R project. To use an R package in your sript, you must load it with the following command:

```r
install.packages("ggplot2")
```

### Upgrading Packages
R packages are often constantly updated on CRAN or GitHub, so you may want to update them once in a while with:
```r
update.packages(ask = FALSE)
```

## Loading Data
### Csv File
```{r eval=FALSE}
df <- read.csv("datafile.csv")
df <- read.csv("datafile.csv", header=FALSE, stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
```
```{r rbasics readcsv}
df <- read.csv("https://github.com/retomarek/r/raw/master/datasets/buildingMonitoringTestDataSet.csv",
               stringsAsFactors=FALSE,
               sep ="," )
```
Attention: By default, strings in the data are treated as factors. 
read.csv() is a convenience wrapper function around read.table(). If you need more control over the input, see ?read.table

### Excel File
```{r eval=FALSE}
# Only need to install once
install.packages("xlsx")

library(xslx)

df <- read.xlsx("datafile.xlsx", 1)
df <- read.xlsx("datafile.xls", sheetIndex=2)
df <- read.xlsx("datafile.xls", sheetName="Revenues")
```

For reading older Excel files in the .xls format, the gdata package has the function read.xls():
```{r eval=FALSE}
# Only need to install once
install.packages("gdata")

library(gdata)
# Read first sheet
df <- read.xls("datafile.xls")
df <- read.xls("datafile.xls", sheet=2)
```

Both the xlsx and gdata packages require other software to be installed on your computer. For xlsx, you need to install Java on your machine. For gdata, you need Perl, which comes as standard on Linux and Mac OS X, but not Windows. On Windows, you’ll need ActiveState Perl. The Community Edition can be obtained for free.
